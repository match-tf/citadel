                    <p>Match.tf is a tournament hosting system, crafted just for TF2. </p>
                    <p>We provide a complete and free service that will help you to run a competition of any size: from 1-night cups to LANs and competitive leagues. We have tournament brackets, rosters, divs, easy pick/ban system, match scheduling, medal distribution helper and much more. </p>
                    <p>Yes, that means you no longer need to keep track of your participants if you are lucky enough to be given an ability of medal distribution. </p>
                    <p>You no longer need to ask captains to report scores in Discord (seriously, it's 2018 right now!). </p>
