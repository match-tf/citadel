This format generally utilizes class limits of 2 on all classes save for Demo, Medic, Heavy, which have a class limit of 1 (this can vary depending on the league and ruleset of the league). 6v6 is mostly played on 5CP maps,as well as King of the Hill (KOTH) and Attack/Defence (A/D) maps.', player_count: 6)

This format is played with class limits of 1 for all classes, with far more lenient weapon bans than 6v6 in most cases. Highlander is played on payload, KOTH, 5CP, and A/D maps. This format is generally accepted as the entry format to competitive tf2 as it has less entry barriers and is the format that best emulates pub play.', player_count: 9)

The objective is similar to King of the Hill, capture and defend the point from the opposing team. To win, you must run down the timer, which is done so by capturing the point. Since this gamemode consists of only a Soldier and Medic, it is heavily reliant on deathmatch skills.', player_count: 2)
tf2_bb = Format.create(game: tf2, name: 'BBall', description: 'BBall is often considered the "bar pool" of TF2, as many high and low level players across different leagues play it, and little infrastructure is needed to start games or tournaments in it. The game is played on a replication of a basketball court, with the intel being used as a ball. Players must use a combination of rocket jumping and DM to take the ball from their opponents, and jump into (on top of) their hoop while holding it. The ball initially spawns in the center of the court. When a side scores a point, the intel spawns near the opposite sides hoop, giving the team (to most recently lose a point) an advantage in the next play. The majority of weapons are banned in BBall, usually save for the Original, and in some cases the Escape Plan and Gunboats.', player_count: 2)

Medics, Demomen and Scouts are commonly seen in this format, with Pyro and Soldier appearing quite often as well. The format has seen three One Night Cups, as well as an ongoing 5-week league.

The gamemode promotes prolific switching between classes as certain situations call for certain resources. Most commonly, a team will run one each of Scout, Soldier, Demoman, Medic, and have three extra players switching between utility classes. Currently, only RGL.gg supports the format.
